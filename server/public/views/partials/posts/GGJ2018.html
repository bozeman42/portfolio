    Over the last weekend I participated in the
    <a href="https://globalgamejam.org/">2018 Global Game Jam</a> with
    <a href="https://www.gamecraft.mn/">GameCraftMN</a>. I would first like to talk about the experience of the game jam, and some small things I learned about C#. There were some design patterns I learned but I'm still working on a good analogy for how to describe them.
  </p>

    After an introductory presentation, attendees were given some time to mingle and come up with project ideas. We reconvened
    and people lined up and gave brief pitches for their game ideas to the crowd. After the pitches were made, I decided
    to approach a team working with a technology that excites me: VR. It was a team of 11 people, mostly composed of 3D artists.
    They were in need of developers and they welcomed me to the team.

    We spent the first day scoping the project and solidifying the preliminary narrative. The concept of the game was that there
    are some space druids and they live in symbiosis with a large
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ent">ent-like</a> creature. The space druids are controlled by up to four players using X-Box controllers and the Ent is the
    VR player using a Vive VR headset and controllers. The druids collect resources and bring them back to the Ent, which
    is rooted in place. The Ent assists the druids in collecting the resources by moving logs over rivers to form bridges
    and picking up and throwing the players when they enter a large walnut-like vessel. The druids have a day (5 minutes
    of game time) to collect enough resources for the Ent to be able to protect them in the night.

    The project was being built with the Unity game engine and was written in C#. I had no experience with either of those things,
    but I was eager to learn. I was able to piece together some basics of how the controls worked and I was able to create
    controls for the four 'couch co-op' players.
  </p>
  <p>
    At the end of the first night I asked the more experienced developers what I should research to be able to better contribute
    the next day. They suggested looking at
    <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.html">Unity MonoBehaviors</a> and creating a basic Unity project to familiarize myself with the interface. I built a
    <a href="https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/s/roll-ball-tutorial">small project</a> to learn the ropes.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the end I was able to make some modest but meaningful contributions to the project and built a base of knowledge from
    which I can explore Unity with greater confidence.

    I hadn't been exposed to C# before this event and it contains a handy operator that I appreciate. It is a <em>null conditional</em> operator. Let's say you have an object that may be <code>null</code>. In your code you wish to access a property on this object so long as the object is not null. There is a very concise way to write this in C#.
  </p>
    <code>
      MyObject?.MyProperty
    </code>
  </p>
  <p>
    This will return null if the object is null, and the property if the object is not null. Very handy!
